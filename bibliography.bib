	abstract = {— Many computers and devices are becoming more connected to the internet in recent years; the use of the Internet Protocol (IP) has made the connectivity and identification of these devices possible in large scale. In this paper, we will discuss the evolution of Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4), its features, issues and limitations and how Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) tends to solve some of these issues including the differences and transition between these two protocols.},

	abstract = {2nd ed. Revised edition of: IPv6 clearly explained. c1999. The second edition of IPv6: Theory, Protocol, and Practice guides readers through implemetation and deployment of IPv6. The Theory section takes a close, unbiased look at why so much time and effort has been expended on revising IPv4. In the Protocol section is a comprehensive review of the specifics of IPv6 and related protocols. Finally, the Practice section provides hands-on explanations of how to roll out IPv6 support and services. This completely rewritten edition offers updated and comprehensive coverage of important topics including router and server configuration, security, the impact of IPv6 on mobile networks, and evaluating the impact of IPv6-enabled networks globally. Pete Loshin's famously lucid explanations benefit readers at every turn, making Ipv6: Theory, Protocol, and Practice the best way for a large diverse audience to get up to speed on this groundbreaking technology. * The comprehensive, accessible, and up-to-date resource needed by network engineers and support staff, product developers and managers, programmers, and marketing professionals * Divided into sections on theory, the protocol's technical details, and techniques for building Ipv6 networks, this book covers not only the protocol but the ways in which the protocol can be integrated into networks. * Covers critical topics in depth, including router and server configuration, security, value assessment, and the impact of Ipv6 on global networks. PART I: IPv6 Theory; PART II: IPv6 Protocol; PART III: IPv6 Practice.},

	abstract = {This document reviews the concepts of IPv6 Extension Header (EH). It focuses on the implications that the presence of extension headers have on the native IPv6 traffic forwarding performance of network devices. IPV6 EXTENSION HEADERS This section reviews the headers used by the IPv6 protocol. The Concept IPv6 is using two distinct types of headers: Main/Regular IPv6 Header and IPv6 Extension Headers. The main IPv6 header is equivalent to the basic IPv4 one despite some field differences that are the result of lessons learned from operating IPv4. Figure 1 presents the IPv4 and IPv6 main headers. Figure 1. IPv4 and IPv6 Headers The options field in the IPv4 header is used to convey additional information on the packet or on the way it should be processed. Routers, unless instructed otherwise [1], must process the options in the IPv4 header. The processing of most header options pushes the packet into the slow path leading to a forwarding performance hit.},
