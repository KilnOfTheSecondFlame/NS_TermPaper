	abstract = {— Many computers and devices are becoming more connected to the internet in recent years; the use of the Internet Protocol (IP) has made the connectivity and identification of these devices possible in large scale. In this paper, we will discuss the evolution of Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4), its features, issues and limitations and how Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) tends to solve some of these issues including the differences and transition between these two protocols.},
